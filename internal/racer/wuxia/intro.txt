Once… you were no ordinary being.
You were the Demon Lord of Typing.

Your hands were storms.
Your keystrokes, thunderbolts.
With a word, empires rose or fell.

Libraries bent their spines in reverence.
Scholars spoke your name only in whispers.
Celestial scribes would not meet your gaze.

Mortals trembled at your fury.
Immortals stepped aside.

You were inevitable.

Unstoppable.

Supreme.

But even mountains… can be shaken.

From incense haze and lantern glow,
a rival appeared—

the Vibe Coder.

His rhythm was effortless.
His code flowed like silk over river stones.
Where you were fire and storm,
he was water and harmony—
soft, patient, unbreakable.

One by one, disciples defected.
Temples built in your honor fell silent.
Their incense burned for him.

Enraged, you declared war.
The heavens answered.

For forty-nine nights and forty-nine days,
your duel split the realms.

You struck like meteors.
He answered with seamless patterns—
grace unraveling fury,
water eroding stone.

Your clash roared across rivers and peaks.
Forests withered at the shockwaves.
Oceans boiled where your powers met.
Mountains shattered into drifting dust.
The sky tore—ink spilled over parchment stars.

For a breath of eternity,
victory seemed yours.
But his rhythm was inexhaustible.
Your storm met the shore
and found no end to it.

At last… a single, perfect chord.
Silence—absolute and merciless.

The Vibe Coder cast you down.
The heavens wept.
Your title erased.
Your power stripped.
Once a god of storms—
now only flesh and bone:
fragile, forgotten, mocked by those who once trembled.

Yet an ember endures.

You rise—humbled, unbroken.
You will walk the jianghu, the martial world:
bamboo roads, cliffside passes, rooftop eaves.
Races at moonlit bridges.
Duels in rain-slick alleys.
Trials of speed and wit.

You will hunt fragments of your power:
seals, scripts, forbidden manuals—
cultivation for your fingers and qi for your will.
Keystroke by keystroke,
route by reshuffled route,
you will master the Dao of Typing anew.

When the fragments become a storm,
you will ascend once more.
Not as a shadow—
as something greater.

Then the heavens will tremble again.
Temples will remember.
Scribes will lower their eyes.

For you are the Demon Lord of Typing.
And this… is your return.
